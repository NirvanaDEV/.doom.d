# .doom.d

## About
This is my personal doom emacs config. Some of the config is for handling
MacOSX. Just comment those parts out if your on Linux. If your on Winblows...
May God have mercy on your soul. LOL! Just kidding, but seriously...

## Why
I like to keep my setup the same on various different systems running OSX and
Linux. This allows me to easily keep eveything the same. Doom Emacs is one hell
of a setup and doesn't really need too much config. I just wanted to a little to
assist with my daily workflow.

## Requirements
This requires a working install of Doom Emacs which can be found here: https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs

## Install
1. Backup your current `~/.doom.d/` directory if you have one.
2. Clone the repo to your home directory `git clone https://github.com/NirvanaDEV/.doom.d.git ~/`
